jenkins master  : running in docker container

docker pull jenkins

look out for admin login

manage neccesary plugins 
git ssh 


Jenkins slave is itself a ec2 machine on which docker container is running.

jenkins slave config

manage new node :  
username : ubuntu 
it's home dir : create it on slave side : /var/home/jenkins
chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /var/home/jenkins

manage ssh credentials : 

provide username : ubuntu
copy and paste slave private key in the jenkins store 


Now make sure your jenkins master has access to slave via ssh

steps to do that : 
a) make sure this file exits at jenkins master /var/jenkins_home.ssh/known_hosts
b) ssh-keyscan -H >> /var/jenkins_home.ssh/known_hosts ec2-i.p./hostname or copy and paste ~/.ssh/known_hosts from which you have logged into the ec2-machine with the same key file.
